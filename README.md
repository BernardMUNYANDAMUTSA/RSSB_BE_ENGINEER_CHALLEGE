Strategy:

1. First, gather requirements from the business team and other stakeholders to understand the needs and goals of the project.
This will involve working closely with the product owner, UI/UX designers, and other subject matter experts to define the features and functionality of the new back-end solution.

2. Next, assess the current technology stack and identify any potential bottlenecks or areas for improvement.
This will involve reviewing the existing codebase, as well as analyzing data on system performance, user behavior, and other relevant metrics.

3. Based on the requirements and assessment of the current technology stack, develop a plan for the new back-end solution.
This will involve selecting the appropriate technologies and frameworks, designing the architecture and data model, and identifying any dependencies or integration points with other systems.

4. Engage with the front-end team to ensure that the back-end solution aligns with the needs and goals of the user interface. 
This will involve collaborating on API design and other integration points, as well as providing guidance on how to consume the back-end APIs and services.

5. As the back-end solution is being developed, focus on writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code that adheres to best practices and industry standards.
This will involve using version control, testing frameworks, and other tools to ensure the quality and reliability of the codebase.

6. Before going live with the new back-end solution, conduct thorough testing and QA to ensure that it meets the requirements and performs well in a production environment. 
This will involve collaborating with the QA team to define and execute test cases, as well as working with the operations team to prepare for the deployment of the new system.

7. Once the new back-end solution is live, continue to monitor and optimize its performance and stability, and iterate on the codebase as needed to address any issues or add new features.


Strategy or plan needs to show what needs to happen from day 1 until go-live of the pilot system.

1. Project Initiation:

Define the project's objectives, scope, and goals.
Appoint a project manager and assemble the project team.
Establish clear communication channels and reporting structures.
2. Requirements Gathering:

Identify and document the specific requirements for the pilot system.
Engage stakeholders to ensure their input and needs are considered.
3.System Selection and Design:

Choose the appropriate system or technology for the pilot.
Design the system architecture and user interface based on the gathered requirements.

4. Development and Testing:

Develop the pilot system according to the design.
Conduct rigorous testing to identify and fix any issues or bugs.
Ensure data security and compliance with relevant regulations.

5. User Training:

Train end-users and administrators on how to use the pilot system.
Provide training materials and user guides.

6. Data Migration:

If applicable, migrate data from the old system to the pilot system.
Verify data integrity and consistency.

7. Pilot Implementation:

Roll out the pilot system to a limited group of users or within a specific department.
Monitor its performance and gather feedback from users.

8. Feedback and Iteration:

Collect feedback from pilot users regarding system functionality and usability.
Use this feedback to make necessary improvements and iterations to the system.

9. Documentation and Standard Operating Procedures:

Document all system configurations, processes, and procedures.
Create standard operating procedures (SOPs) for system usage and maintenance.

10. Change Management:

Develop a change management plan to address any organizational or process changes resulting from the new system.
Communicate changes to all relevant stakeholders.

11. Performance Testing and Optimization:

Conduct performance testing to ensure the system can handle anticipated loads.
Optimize the system for performance and scalability as needed.

12. User Acceptance Testing:

Conduct user acceptance testing with a broader user group to validate that the system meets their needs.

13. Deployment Planning:

Plan the deployment process, including timing, user access, and contingency measures.
Ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place for the go-live.

14. Go-Live Preparation:

Finalize all system configurations.
Prepare a rollback plan in case issues arise during go-live.
Notify all relevant parties about the upcoming go-live date.

15. Go-Live:

Deploy the pilot system to all intended users.
Monitor the system closely during the initial days to address any issues promptly.

16. Post-Go-Live Support:

Provide continuous support and assistance to users.
Monitor system performance and address any issues that arise.

17. Evaluation and Feedback:

Collect feedback from users and stakeholders post-go-live.
Evaluate the success of the pilot system in meeting its objectives.

18. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer:

Update all documentation and knowledge bases with any post-go-live changes.
Ensure knowledge transfer to relevant teams for ongoing maintenance.

19. Project Closure:

Complete any outstanding project documentation.
Conduct a project review and identify lessons learned for future implementations.
